                <br>
                <p>
                    The target audience is people wanting to visit the Space Coast, as well as current and potential
                    business owners of the Space Coast.

                <p>
                    Forty-seven year old David wants to expand his landscaping business into the Space Coast. He has the
                    opportunity to partner with the Chamber of Commerce so that his business can get root in his new
                    town. He is looking for connections, referrals, and to gain a good reputation in the community. Most
                    of the time, he uses his desktop computer from home, and sometimes his mobile phone for internet
                    access.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Frank, a German man in his late thirties, has planned a visit to the Space Coast to watch a rocket
                    launch. The launch was delayed, and he is now wondering what to do in the meantime while he stays
                    the extra two days in town, waiting. He is referred to the Chamber of Commerce website to look for
                    places to eat, local crafts, and the businesses that rent kayaks and fishing equipment. He uses his
                    mobile phone, and sometimes his tablet to access the internet.
